## Solution

To solve this, I used steghide and a tool online to extract metadata.

The metadata revealed the password was borkbork. 

I took this password and extracted a hidden file within doggo.jpg using the following command:

steghide extract -sf doggo.jpg

This extracted a pdf titled "itsasecret.pdf", which contained the flag:

flag{whos_A_g00d_boi_bork_bork}
