# Deadface 2022 Steganography Challenges


## The Goodest boy

We are given an image, doggo.jpg, and a link to a GhostTown thread.

The challenge: 

We found this image on Ghost Town. We think bumpyhassan hid some information here. Can you see what information he hid?

### The image:


### The thread:



### Solution

To solve this, I used steghide and a tool online to extract metadata.

The metadata revealed the password was borkbork. 

I took this password and extracted a hidden file within doggo.jpg using the following command:

steghide extract -sf doggo.jpg

This extracted a pdf titled "itsasecret.pdf", which contained the flag:

flag{whos_A_g00d_boi_bork_bork}



## Lifes a Glitch

### Challenge:

Another one of De Monne's employees was compromised. DEADFACE left a GIF image of what looks like a glitched face. They claim there is a flag in the GIF. See if you can use your repertoire to find the flag hidden in the gif.

### Solution

This was pretty easy to solve, once you did the first one. By uploading the gif to ezgif.com I was able to split the gif by frame and remove any image optimizations.

Once the gif was split, I was able to see the flag in clear text as flag{c0rrupt3d!}. I did edit the flag a bit more to make it more visible.
