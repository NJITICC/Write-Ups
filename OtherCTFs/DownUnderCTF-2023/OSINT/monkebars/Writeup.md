## Description

I will be dropping my new track monke bars soon! But I suck at rap and don't want to share it...

Can you find the song?

## Steps I took

It wasn't straight forward with *what* we were looking for, all I knew was we needed to find the song.

I checked all of the usual suspects for media: youtube, spotify, twitter (x? nah, still twitter), even TikTok. Unfortunately Monke Bars just popping up with:

And since this was "dropping soon", and the youtube video shown above was 2+ years old? Yeah, not it.

I then went to Bandcamp and Soundcloud. I originally looked for ghostccamm, and then just ccamm, but nothing was popping up... Until:
