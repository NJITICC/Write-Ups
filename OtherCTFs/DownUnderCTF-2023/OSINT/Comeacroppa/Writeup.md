Okay, so this was the easiest one I saw. 

Description:
I was sorting through my photo album and I cannot seem to place this picture. Can you let me know what suburb this is in?

# Figure out the end goal

I need to find the suburb

Can't tell much from the photo, just that it's a rustic looking building, # 63 is on the door. The buildings look old, but maintained.


# Take action

I suppose you could try to check the meta data, and I didn't even bother with this one. I just tossed it into Google Image search, and came up with Main St. Traders as the top result:

I saw this was on the maldon museum website, and learned about Maldon. But, that was just for fun, because the answer *was* maldon. Google street view would also give you that answer in confirmation!
