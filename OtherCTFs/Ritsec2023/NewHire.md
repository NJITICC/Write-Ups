## Description

We're thinking of hiring this new guy, what do you think of his skills?

https://www.linkedin.com/in/bingus-quatuam-666704231/

NOTE: You will need to add in the brackets after the RS to make the format RS{}


## Solution Steps:

Obviously the first thing to do here is to load the linkedin profile of Bingus.
