## Description

We think we are going to hire that Bingus Guy. His trading habits seem a bit off though.

## Solution Steps

Pretty straightforward. I know why some people were bothered by this, but honestly it wasn't hard. You just had to go through.

It was fun, straightforward, and involved critical thinking (albeit, not much, in my opinion).

It's clear from Bingus's profile that he was throwing stocks around. Wonder why?

Well if you check for these stocks and their ticker symbols, you'll find out:


I noticed his posts he kept mentioning stocks during New Hire, actually. First post mentioned Ryder and Sentinel One, RS. Flags start with RS here so...

Second Post: Sea Ltd (SE) CitiGroup (C)

That's RS{SEC so far...

Third post: United Rentals (URI), Tri-Continental Corp (TY)

Fourth post: ASA Gold(ASA) and Sea Ltd (SE)

Fifth post: Ryder Systems again (R) and AdvisorShares Vice ETF(VICE)

Flag: RS{SECURITYASASERVICE}
